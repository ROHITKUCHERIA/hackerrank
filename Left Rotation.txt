# A left rotation operation on an array of size N shifts each of the array's elements l  
unit to the left.For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array ,[1,2,3,4,5],
then the array would become .[3,4,5,1,2].

n, d = map(int, input().split())
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

for i in range(d):
    arr.append(arr[i])
    
for x in arr[d:]:
    print(x, end=' ')
